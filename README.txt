Usage:
  Configure a bot as normal, as explained in https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html .
  The bot needs the following permissions enabled: (TODO check)
    - Read Messages / View Channels
    - Send Messages
    - (TODO) Read Message History (for edits?)
  The bot needs a config.json file set up in the same folder as the bot.py script, with the following content:
    {"token":"<your token goes here>"}
